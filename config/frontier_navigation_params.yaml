#params to setup frontier navigation

# Rectangle around robot in which frontiers will be detected
# Further settings will be added
radius: 5.0
# Attempts to find frontiers within an increasing rectangle around robot
attempts: 5
# Radius will be increased be stepping
stepping: 5.0
# Sets of connected frontiers which are smaller will not be considered for next goal
threshold: 100
# Should be zero. Is being used for debbuging issues [s]
sleep: 0
# Minimum distance to frontiers. Necessary for avoiding path planing problems
minDistance: 3.0
# Maximum waiting time for new scans/map.
# Reasons for timeout:
# - path planing failure
# - robot doesn't move
# - collision
# Robot will be forced to move after timeout [s]
timeout: 20.0
# Attempts to get robot into a better position. If this fails robot will be stuck!
timeoutAttempts: 5
# settings for function which evaluates quality of set of connected frontiers
